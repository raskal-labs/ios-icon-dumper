# iOS Icon Toolkit

a unified kit of "tools" for grabbin iOS app icons that may or may not work for you - better probably exists elsewhere, i promise...

**Release:** v2.0.0
**Compatibility:** iOS 15+ (Rootless/Rootful), macOS, Linux

## 📦 The Scripts

| File | Version | Role | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ios-icon-downloader.sh`** | **v1.0** | **Downloader** | Fetches high-res marketing icons from Apple servers. |
| **`ios-icon-extractor.sh`** | **v2.0** | **Extractor** | Scans device and extracts actual icon files from installed apps. |

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Discovery & Extraction (Run `Extractor` on Phone)
Use the Extractor (v2) to scan your device, build the master ID list, and dump your local icons.

```bash
# Discover apps & Extract local icons
./ios-icon-extractor.sh discover
./ios-icon-extractor.sh run
Output: artifacts/extracted/

2. High-Res Enrichment (Run Downloader Anywhere)
Use the Downloader (v1) to read the list generated by the Extractor and fetch higher quality artwork.

Bash

# Download 512px icons for the discovered IDs
./ios-icon-downloader.sh run
Output: artifacts/downloaded/

⚙️ Configuration
Both scripts use dumper.conf.

Bash

# dumper.conf
OUTPUT_ROOT="./artifacts"
META_DIR="./_meta"
📝 Quick Notes
Setup: Rename dumper.template.conf to dumper.conf to activate custom paths.

Dependencies: The Extractor (v2) requires plutil (install via Sileo/Zebra). The Downloader (v1) only requires curl.

Rootless: Both scripts are fully compatible with iOS 15+ Rootless environments (Dopamine/Palera1n).
